/**
 * A simple class to model a date without modeling time.
 * Internal, this class stores a date with year, month, and day of month precision. 
 * 
 * <p>This class is designed to represent the data type of a Session start date and end date.
 * To simplify the implementation of data constraints and ensuring data integrity associated with a Session's start date and end date, 
 * this class is designed so that objects of this type are immutable. Thus, this class ensures that a UDate object's value can not change after construction.
